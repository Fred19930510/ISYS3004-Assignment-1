		<h3>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</h3>
		<p>
			Curtin University is committed to supporting all our students and staff whether they are on campus, working 
remotely or overseas. Your health, safety and wellbeing are our priority and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic 
may require changes to the unit schedule, learning activities, delivery modes and assessment to provide flexible 
and safe options to our community. Curtin will endeavour to keep changes and disruptions to a minimum at all 
times. For current advice and further information visit https://www.curtin.edu.au/novel-coronavirus/.

		<h3>Syllabus</h3>
		<p>
			The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development 
methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools. 
		</p>
		<hr class="divide_line"/>
		
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate 
technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the 
structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's 
behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business 
context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify 
stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-
based applications
		</p>
		<hr class="divide_line"/>
		
		<h3>Unit Learning Outcomes</h3>
		<p>
			All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These 
inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills 
and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the 
Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process 
referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know, 
understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully 
designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of 
the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities 
through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.

confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking 
criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to 
ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.  </p>


		<h4>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h4>
		<p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries  </li>
			<li>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where 
students have not met the pass requirements </li>
			<li>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations  </li>
			<li>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Late assessment </h4>
		<p>Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit. </p>

		<p></p>
		
		<h4>Assessment extension </h4>
		<p>Where an application for an assessment extension is permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to 
the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline): </p>
		<p></p>
		
		<p class = "indent_2">1.   A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of exceptional 
circumstances beyond the student’s control, may apply for an assessment extension on the Assessment 
Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on the Forms 
page at <a href="">https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms/</a> and also within the student's 
OASIS (My Studies tab – Quick Forms) account.    </p>
		<p class = "indent_2">2.  The student will be expected to submit their application for an Assessment Extension with supporting 
documentation <a href="">via the online form.</a>    </p>
		<p class = "indent_2">3.  Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are declined, 
delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.   </p>
		<p class = "indent_2">4.  An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment item 
where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the 
application prior to the assessment due date/time    </p>

		<p></p>
		
		<h4>Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities/health circumstances likely to impact on 
studies</h4>
		<p>A <a href="">Curtin Access Plan</a> (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and level of support required by a student with a 
disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin. Carers for people with disability 
may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials 
in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from 
<a href="">AccessAbility Services. </a></p>
		<p>Documentation is required from your treating Health Professional to confirm your health circumstances or carer 
responsibilities. </p>
		<p>If you think you may be eligible for a CAP, please contact AccessAbility Services. If you already have a CAP please 
provide it to the Unit Coordinator in week 1 of each study period. </p>
