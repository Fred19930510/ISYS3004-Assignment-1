## The SPA Project

Some problems in this task:

1. The table content is vertically centered by default. I tried some methods such as setting the valign attribute to try to align the content at the top, but still couldn't achieve the desired effect.
2. Improper alignment occurs when tables are nested in a table. I checked the code carefully, but found nothing wrong, I don't know what caused it.
3. The borders of multiple cells in the table will be thicker when they overlap, while the borders that do not overlap will look thinner, resulting in a very different look when there is only one border and when there are multiple borders that overlap.
